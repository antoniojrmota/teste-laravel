# JSON Translation Helper for Laravel
JSON Translation Helper scans your project for `__()`, `lang()` translation helper methods and `@lang` directives, then it creates keys in your JSON translation files. 

And yes, it avoids duplicates â€“ helper creates only non-existing keys. Ready for your translation.

## Installation

First, install JSON Translation Helper using the Composer require command:

```
composer require subotkevic/laravel-json-translation-helper
```

That's it. Package registers service provider automatically.

## Usage

### Translation files

First, you have to create your translation files for languages you will translate your application to. 

For example, if you want your application to have a Spanish translation, you should create a `resources/lang/es.json` file.

Of course you can have multiple translation files:
```
resources/
    lang/
        es.json
        fr.json
```

Make sure that your translation files is valid JSON, otherwise our package will not work:

```json
{
    "I love programming.": "Me encanta programar."
}
```

If you don't have any translations for now, just **make sure your file is not empty**, but actually an empty JSON object:
```js
{}
```

### Scan your application

Finally, to scan your application for missing translation keys just run:

```
php artisan translation:scan
```


## Configuration

### Publishing configuration

First, publish the configuration file:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="JsonTranslationHelper\TranslationHelperServiceProvider"
```

It will bring you `config/translation-helper.php` configuration file. 

Read the following sections of what you can configure.

### Directories

To specify where you want to scan for translation strings, just modify `scan_directories` array:
```php
/**
 * Directories to scan for missing translation keys.
 */
'scan_directories' => [
    app_path(),
    resource_path('views'),
    resource_path('assets'),
],
``` 

### File extensions

Our package scans only `.php` files out of the box.

You can add more file extensions to `file_extensions` array in the `config/translation-helper.php` configuration file to scan, let's say, `.vue` or `.js` files:
```php
/**
 * File extensions to scan from.
 */
'file_extensions' => [
    'php',
    'js',
    'vue',
],
```

### Translation helper methods

By default our package looks for `lang()` and `__()` translation helper methods and directives.

But you can extend, modify, or remove them in the config file by modifying `translation_methods` array:
```php
/**
 * Translation helper methods to scan
 * for in your application's code.
 */
'translation_methods' => [
    'lang',
    '__',
],
```
